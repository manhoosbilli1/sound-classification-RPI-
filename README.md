## EARS: Environmental Audio Recognition System

**EARS** is a proof of concept implementation of a ***convolutional neural network*** for **live environmental audio processing & recognition** on low-power [*SoC*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip) devices (at this time it has been developed and tested on a ***Raspberry Pi 3 Model B***).

EARS features a background thread for **audio capture & classification** and a [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/) server based dashboard providing **live visualization** and **audio streaming** from the device to the browser.

### Caveats: ###

EARS is quite taxing on the CPU, so some proper cooling solution (heatsink) is advisable. Nevertheless, when not using the Bokeh app too much, it should work fine even without one.

The live audio stream can get choppy or out-of-sync, especially when using the mute/unmute button.

Actual production deployments would profit from a server-node architecture where SoC devices are only pushing predictions, status updates and audio feeds to a central server handling all end user interaction, material browsing and visualization. This may be implemented in future versions, but no promises here.

## Installation

EARS has been developed and tested on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B device. To recreate the environment used for developing this demo:

### Step 1 - prepare a Raspberry Pi device
- Get a spare Raspberry Pi 3 Model B with a blank SD card.
- Install a Raspbian Jessie Lite distribution (tested on version April 2017):
  - Download a Raspbian Jessie Lite image from [RaspberryPi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).
  - Use Etcher to flash the SD card (see [Raspberry Pi docs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md) for details).
- Boot the device with the new card.
- Attach some input & display devices for configuration.
- Login using default credentials (`user: pi, password: raspberry`).
- Setup Wi-Fi access (see [Wi-Fi config on Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md)).
- Use `sudo raspi-config` to enable SSH.
- Recreate SSH host keys:

```bash
sudo rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*
sudo dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server
```
  
### Step 2 - install Python 3.6 using [Berry Conda](https://github.com/jjhelmus/berryconda)

- Install conda for armv7l to `/opt/conda`:

```bash
wget http://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-armv7l.sh
chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-armv7l.sh
sudo ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-armv7l.sh
```
 
- Add `export PATH="/opt/conda/bin:$PATH"` to the end of `/home/pi/.bashrc`. Then reload with `source /home/pi/.bashrc`.

- Install Python with required packages:

```bash
conda config --add channels rpi
conda create -n ears python=3.6
source activate ears
conda install cython numpy pandas scikit-learn cffi h5py
```

- Make sure PortAudio headers are available. If not, installing pyaudio will complain later on:

```bash
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
```

### Step 3 - download EARS and install requirements

- Download EARS source code and unpack it to `/home/pi/ears`. Then install the required packages by issuing:

```bash
pip install -r /home/pi/ears/requirements.txt
```

- Plug a *Zoom H1* microphone into the USB port (or some other audio device, but that's the one I used for initial testing), switch it into an audio interface mode (44.1 kHz/16 bit), and verify it's listed by `python -m sounddevice`.
- Update the `--allow-websocket-origin` option inside `/home/pi/ears/run.sh` file with the IP address of the Raspberry Pi device.
- Finally, run the app with:

```bash
chmod +x /home/pi/ears/run.sh
cd /home/pi/ears
./run.sh
```

- Point the web browser to: `http://RASPBERRY_PI_IP:5006/`

## Training new models

For the time being, EARS comes preloaded with a very rudimentary model trained on the [**ESC-50 dataset**](https://github.com/karoldvl/ESC-50) (convnet consisting of 3 layers, 3x3 square filters), so it's recognition capabilities are limited for actual live scenarios.

If you want to train the same model on a different dataset:
- Download the source code to a workstation/server with a GPU card.
- Put all audio files (WAV) into `ears/dataset/audio`.
- Replace the [`ears/dataset/dataset.csv`](ears/dataset/dataset.csv) file with new CSV:

```csv
filename,category
```

- Run `python train.py` - this should result in the following files being generated on the server:

File                | Description
------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- 
`model.h5`          | weights of the learned model
`model.json`        | a serialized architecture of the model (Keras >=2.0.0)  
`model_labels.json` | dataset labels

- Upload the new model files to the Raspberry Pi device and restart the app.

If you want to train a completely different model, then you can have a look at [`train.py`](ears/train.py). In this case you probably know what to do either way.
